## Summary

### Setting Up the Sort
<img src="./src/images/SetUp.gif" />

When the user first lands on Sorting Algorithm Visualizer they are met with a 
series of options. There is a **sliding bar** that allows the user to change the
amount of elements in the array. The **toggle** next to the slide changes the visual
style from a **bar-style** to a **gradient style**. The bar length and gradient shade
are randomly generated every time the user changes the array size or clicks
`Generate New Array`.
